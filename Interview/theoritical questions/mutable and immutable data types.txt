In Python, data types can be categorized into two main categories based on their mutability: mutable and immutable.

1. Mutable Data Types:

Mutable data types can be modified or altered after creation.
Changes to a mutable object are reflected in-place, meaning the object itself can be modified without creating a new object.

Examples of mutable data types in Python:
Lists
Dictionaries
Sets
User-defined classes (objects)

2. Immutable Data Types:

Immutable data types cannot be modified once they are created.
Any attempt to modify an immutable object results in creating a new object.
Examples of immutable data types in Python:

Integers
Floats
Strings
Tuples
Frozensets
Numbers
None
